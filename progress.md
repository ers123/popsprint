Original prompt: so, I want you to think harder on this edge. When the player start the game, i think it is necessary that the game screen should in full-screen mode, especially when users are coming in from the mobile environment. Also, if that being the case, I think it is essential to upgrade the overall game experience.

- Phase 4 started.
- Goal: fullscreen-first start flow on mobile with safe fallback + immersive UX improvements.
- Constraints: preserve performance and existing gameplay loop.

- Implemented fullscreen-first controls in game UI:
  - Added Fullscreen button next to Start/Pause.
  - Added automatic fullscreen request on mobile start with fallback status messaging.
  - Added `f` keyboard shortcut toggle and fullscreenchange handling.
- Added focus-mode classes to reduce UI clutter during active rounds.
- Added deterministic hooks for test workflow:
  - `window.render_game_to_text`
  - `window.advanceTime(ms)`

- Ran Playwright client against local server with action bursts and screenshot/state capture.
- Artifacts generated under output/web-game (shot-0.png, shot-1.png, state-0.json, state-1.json).
- Verified deterministic hooks return concise interactive state and pause/run modes.
- No new error artifact file generated by the client run.
- Remaining suggestion: consider a dedicated fullscreen onboarding toast for first-ever sessions only.
